## Deployed app

https://kf-sorting-hat.netlify.app/

## Overview of the project
The sorting hat allows you to submit a name, which is then sorted into one of the four hogwarts houses. The name populates a card in the First Year Students area. The card displays the student's name, random hogwarts house, and the crest of the corresponding house. The user can expel a student, which will move that student's card into the Voldermort's Army area. 

If a user forgets to type a name, a friendly reminder appears to remind the user that he or she must enter a name. 

First year students are sorted alphabetically.

The application is designed responsively, so the user can use the application on a mobile device.
